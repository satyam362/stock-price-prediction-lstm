# Stock Market Price Prediction using LSTM

## Overview
This project predicts stock price trends using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks based on historical time-series data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Feature Scaling (Normalization)
3. Time-Series Sequence Creation
4. LSTM Model Training
5. Prediction and Visualization

## Results
The model captures overall stock trends and improves accuracy after normalization and hyperparameter tuning.

## How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab and run all cells sequentially.
